## LongTaskList1 -- Brent Shearhart

This Project allows the user to create and maintain a Long Task List Using the Simple Scanning method introduced by Mark Forster. The funtionality enables the user to add tasks to the list, delete tasks from the list, mark tasks as complete, and re-enter tasks that were worked on but not completed. The program allows for a total of 100 items in the whole list, over 4 pages with a capacity of 25 items each. The task list is automatically saved after each change. Through the course of creating this project, I used a physical Konbon Board for task-management purposes. 

### Time usage for each task on my Konbon board was measured in Pomodoros
### 1 Pomodoro = (25min work 5min break)*3 + (25min work 15min break)*1

If I were to continue this project, I would make the code cleaner by breaking things down further and further into methods. Additionally, I would allow for pages to be built as the user adds items as opposed to having a predetermined number of pages for the user to fill.
